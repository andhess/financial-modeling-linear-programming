Binomial Modeling will take pre-processed data, construct a binomial tree of possible scenarios + their probabilities over time, and then will enumerate the outcome + likelihood of each possible scenerio. From each outcome, looking at most likely, average, best, worst, median, and the distribution of each case, we will have a detailed understanding of how each asset will perform over time. This will be used in the LP modeling component.
